# Lab 1

**Due Date:** September 15th

**Assignment Description:**

This lab consists of two parts, and it challenges your creativity and understanding of lexers and regular expressions.

### Part 1: Design a Simple Script

Design a simple script that takes an English sentence(s) as input (either static or dynamic) and outputs the individual words in its own line. For example, if the input is "He is a smart student," the output should be individual words as follows:

He
is
a
smart
student

### Part 2: Edit the Flex Input File

In this part, you are required to edit the Flex input file, specifying your own rules (patterns and actions). Explain what the resultant lexer from your specification file would do. You can modify the Flex input file to tokenize English sentences based on your custom rules and patterns.

**Note:** In both parts of this lab, marks will be awarded for ingenuity and uniqueness in your approach. Be creative and think outside the box!
