**Assignment Description:**

This lab consists of four parts.

1. Write a program to identify programming lines (in the same programming language) as either comments or not.
   Further to this task:
   i. Describe the logic used.
   ii. Was lexical analysis or/and syntax analysis concepts important in your logic? If yes, how?

2. Write a program to test whether a given identifier is valid or not
   Further to this task:

- Tools like Lex and Flex helped users develop lexers to do tasks like the one given above. Using the Flex specification file, develop a simple lexer to validate identifiers.

3. Write a program to construct the LL (1) table for a given CFG. [The CFG can be static i.e. the same CFG all time or dynamic, meaning based on a given structure of your choice, one can specify any CFG and your program produces the relevant LL (1) table].

4. Bonuses:
   a. Using any two files of YACC and Flex, show how a parser is generated.
   b. Write a program to implement operator precedence parsing.
